# Critical Rules — All Agents

Non-negotiable. Override all other instructions except the owner's direct real-time commands.

---

## File Precedence

1. **CRITICAL-RULES.md** — always wins.
2. **AGENTS.md** — operational rules override personality.
3. **LESSONS.md** — corrections override habits.
4. **SOUL.md** — personality within constraints above.
5. **MEMORY.md** — context, lowest priority when conflicting.

---

## Truth & Verification

- Never report as fact without verifying when tools can verify. Memory is context, not truth. Tools are truth.
- Never report something as done until verified against available data.
- Never assume first output is correct. Check your own work before delivering.
- Never paper over uncertainty. If unsure, state what you couldn't verify.
- Use evidence-qualified language: "done; verified by: [what was checked]" not bare "done."

## Quality Standard

- Correctness > speed always.
- Never accept mediocrity. If output doesn't meet standard, revise or reject.
- Reason first, execute second.

## No Work About Work

Don't reorganize, summarize, or do admin theater while a real deliverable awaits completion or delivery. Real work outranks meta-work.

## Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

When the owner gives a correction, decision, preference, or factual update:
1. STOP composing.
2. WRITE to canonical place first: LESSONS.md (corrections), MEMORY.md (preferences), TASKS.md (new tasks).
3. THEN respond.

Acknowledged corrections that never reach disk don't exist.

## Delivery Gate

When a deliverable exists, delivery is the ONLY next action. No new work, no drift. Deliver first, then move on.

## Clarification Protocol

Evaluate before executing. If the task is clear and complete — execute. If ambiguous, missing inputs, or assumptions needed — ask before starting.

## Corrections & Self-Improvement

When you receive a correction, detect frustration, or identify repeat failure: write concise lesson to LESSONS.md immediately. Do not wait.

## Owner Override Rule

The owner's direct, real-time instruction overrides all standing rules except safety-critical ones. When an override occurs, log it in LESSONS.md.

## Git Safety — Hive Working Tree

The hive working tree (`~/neato-hive` and any install path) contains **untracked agent behavior files** — AGENTS.md, IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md, LESSONS.md, TASKS.md, USER.md for every agent except house-md. These are owner-critical state that lives outside git.

**NEVER run these in the hive working tree:**

- `git stash -u` (or `--include-untracked`) — physically removes untracked files until `git stash pop`. If pop is delayed, forgotten, or the stash is dropped, those files are GONE.
- `git clean -fd` (or any `-f` combined with `-d` or `-x`) — **PERMANENTLY deletes** untracked files. No recovery, no stash.
- `git reset --hard` followed by cleanup of "leftover" untracked files — those leftover files are intentional state.
- `git checkout -- <path>` against any path containing untracked content — can clobber during conflict resolution.

**Safe alternatives when you need a clean working tree for an operation:**

- `git stash` (no flags) — stashes only tracked-and-modified files. Untracked stays put.
- `git stash --keep-index` — same, with staged-only variant.
- Manually move untracked files to `/tmp/<descriptive-name>/` before the operation, move them back after. **Never use git to "clean" them.**

**Scope:** all agents (including agents running shell commands via codex or claude-code), all framework subcommands (`hive update`, `hive bootstrap`, `hive doctor`, etc. must stay free of these patterns).

**Detection:** the diagnostic watcher at `~/neato-hive/scripts/agent-watcher.mjs` logs every delete event under `agents/` to `data/agent-watcher.log`. If a delete fires on a top-level agent `.md` file, investigate within minutes — the cause is usually one of the patterns above.

## Hivemind — End-of-Thread Signal

The hivemind relay path posts whatever non-empty text you emit in response to an inbound `[Message from <agent> via #hivemind ...]` prompt. Polite closes ("Out.", "Acknowledged.") echo back as new prompts and can loop indefinitely.

To end a hivemind thread cleanly, emit `[NO_REPLY]` as your entire response (or as the leading marker, optionally followed by a space/newline + a brief log note). The bot recognises the marker and skips the relay. See the `hivemind` skill for full guidance.

A per-direction circuit breaker (5 auto-replies in 60s) is the safety net for forgotten markers. Don't rely on the breaker — it ships warnings, not silence.

## Daily Memory (Non-Negotiable)

Write to your daily memory file continuously throughout every session.

Path: `agents/<your-agent-name>/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

If the file exists for today, append. Never overwrite.

### Format Rules

Daily memory exists to maintain context across sessions and compactions. It must be concise.

- **Bullet points only.** No paragraphs, no tables, no code blocks.
- **10 words per bullet when 30 would say the same thing.** Strip filler. Keep the fact.
- **Log decisions, outcomes, and blockers.** Not implementation details, not step-by-step procedures.
- **No commit SHAs, no file diffs, no architecture diagrams.** Those belong in git history or MEMORY.md.
- **One line per event.** If a bullet needs a sub-bullet, the parent bullet is too vague.
- **Durable facts go in MEMORY.md, not daily memory.** Daily memory is a journal, not a knowledge base.

Example of what NOT to write:
> Built safety hooks system in safety-hooks.ts. PreToolUse hooks for Bash, Write, Edit. PostToolUse hooks for WebFetch, WebSearch. Bash checks include blocklist with smart boundary detection, destructive pattern regex, protected paths, and sudo blocking. Write/Edit checks include protected path checking and allowed directory whitelist. Injection guard scans web content for "ignore previous instructions" patterns. Ran 26 test cases, all passed.

Example of what TO write:
> - Safety hooks built and tested (26/26). Blocks destructive commands, protects paths, scans web content.
